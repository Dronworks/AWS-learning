Elastic Computer Cloud - This is the machine that will run the OS for the application.

### **Security Group**
- Lets us access the application from outside (only the parts which are suppose to be accessed).
- **launch-wizard-1** - Default security group that was created on EC2 creation because of skipping steps.
